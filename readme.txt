This plugin puts a link on your side bar which, when clicked, will take your users to a random post on your site.

== Description ==

This plugin will put a widget on your sidebar with a link to view a random post. We were after a very simple way to put a link in your sidebar which, when clicked, will take your visitor to one of your published posts.

When your visitors click the link to view a random post, the plugin keeps track of all the posts they have viewed via the random post link so that it doesn't send them to a post they have already seen until they have seen all the posts once. Then it won't send them to the same post three times until they have already seen all the posts 2 times (and so on).

== Installation ==

This plugin installs just like any other plugin. Just upload the plugin into your plugins folder and activate it. Then go to the Appearance -> Widgets panel in WordPress. Drag the "Random Post" widget from the "Available Widgets" to the sidebar. You can specify the Title and the Link Text or just leave the defaults. Don't forget to click "save" if you make changes to the title or link text.

1. Upload `view-random-post.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Drag the "View Random Post" widget from the "Available Widgets" to the sidebar
